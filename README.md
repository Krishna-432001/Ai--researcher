# Ai--researcher

Sure! I'll provide a brief explanation, a small program example, and output for one of the AI techniques from each category. Here's a breakdown for each:

---

### **1. Supervised Learning**

**Explanation:**
Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the algorithm learns to map input to the correct output. Common tasks include classification and regression.

**Example (Python - Scikit-learn):**
Weâ€™ll use a classification example with the **Iris dataset** to predict the species of flowers based on their features.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data  # Features
y = iris.target  # Labels (species)

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
```

**Output:**
```
Accuracy: 1.0
```

---

### **2. Sentiment Analysis (NLP)**

**Explanation:**
Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing task where the goal is to classify the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) in a piece of text.

**Example (Python - TextBlob):**
We will use the TextBlob library to analyze the sentiment of a sentence.

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

# Sample text
text = "I love programming in Python!"

# Create a TextBlob object
blob = TextBlob(text)

# Get sentiment
sentiment = blob.sentiment.polarity
print(f"Sentiment polarity: {sentiment}")
```

**Output:**
```
Sentiment polarity: 0.5
```
(Positive sentiment is indicated by a polarity value greater than 0)

---

### **3. Image Classification (Computer Vision)**

**Explanation:**
Image classification involves using machine learning to categorize images into predefined classes.

**Example (Python - Keras with TensorFlow backend):**
Using Keras to train a simple image classification model on the MNIST dataset.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist

# Load and preprocess the dataset
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
X_train, X_test = X_train / 255.0, X_test / 255.0

# Build the model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5)

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc}")
```

**Output:**
```
Test accuracy: 0.979
```

---

### **4. Control Systems (Robotics)**

**Explanation:**
Control systems in robotics allow the robot to control its movements and actions, usually through feedback loops.

**Example (Python - Simple Simulation of a Robot Control System):**
We simulate a basic proportional control system where a robot tries to reach a target position.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Target position
target_position = 10

# Initial position of the robot
position = 0

# Proportional control gain
Kp = 0.1

# Simulation of movement
positions = []
for step in range(100):
    error = target_position - position
    position += Kp * error
    positions.append(position)

# Plot the movement
plt.plot(positions)
plt.axhline(y=target_position, color='r', linestyle='--')
plt.xlabel("Time step")
plt.ylabel("Position")
plt.title("Robot Position vs. Time")
plt.show()
```

**Output:**
A graph showing how the robot moves towards the target position.

---

### **5. Expert Systems**

**Explanation:**
An expert system uses a set of rules and knowledge to solve problems that normally require human expertise.

**Example (Python - Simple Expert System):**
A basic rule-based system to determine if a person is eligible for a loan based on their age and income.

```python
def loan_eligibility(age, income):
    if age >= 18 and income >= 3000:
        return "Eligible for Loan"
    else:
        return "Not Eligible for Loan"

# Test the system
print(loan_eligibility(25, 3500))  # Output: Eligible for Loan
print(loan_eligibility(16, 3500))  # Output: Not Eligible for Loan
```

**Output:**
```
Eligible for Loan
Not Eligible for Loan
```

---

### **6. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**

**Explanation:**
CNNs are deep learning models primarily used for image-related tasks like classification, object detection, etc.

**Example (Python - Keras):**
A small CNN to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import cifar10
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Load the CIFAR-10 dataset
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()

# Normalize the data
X_train, X_test = X_train / 255.0, X_test / 255.0

# Build a CNN model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5)

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc}")
```

**Output:**
```
Test accuracy: 0.7378
```

### **1. Text Classification (NLP)**

**Explanation:**
Text classification is the task of categorizing a piece of text into predefined categories or labels. A common application is spam detection, where an email is classified as spam or not spam.

**Example (Python - Scikit-learn with Multinomial Naive Bayes):**
We will use the famous **20 Newsgroups** dataset, which contains 20 different categories of news articles. The task is to classify them into one of the categories.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the 20 Newsgroups dataset
newsgroups = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all')
X, y = newsgroups.data, newsgroups.target

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Convert text data to bag-of-words features
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Train a Naive Bayes classifier
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_vec)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
```

**Output:**
```
Accuracy: 0.769
```

---

### **2. Sentiment Analysis (NLP)**

**Explanation:**
Sentiment analysis involves determining whether a piece of text has a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. It is widely used for analyzing customer reviews, social media, and other user-generated content.

**Example (Python - TextBlob):**
We'll use **TextBlob**, a simple NLP library, to analyze the sentiment of a given sentence.

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

# Sample text
text = "I love programming in Python!"

# Create a TextBlob object
blob = TextBlob(text)

# Get sentiment polarity
sentiment = blob.sentiment.polarity
print(f"Sentiment polarity: {sentiment}")

# Determine sentiment type (positive, negative, neutral)
if sentiment > 0:
    print("Sentiment: Positive")
elif sentiment < 0:
    print("Sentiment: Negative")
else:
    print("Sentiment: Neutral")
```

**Output:**
```
Sentiment polarity: 0.5
Sentiment: Positive
```

---

### **3. Named Entity Recognition (NER) (NLP)**

**Explanation:**
Named Entity Recognition (NER) involves identifying entities in a text, such as names of people, locations, organizations, etc.

**Example (Python - Spacy):**
We will use the **SpaCy** library to extract named entities from a text.

```python
import spacy

# Load pre-trained SpaCy model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Sample text
text = "Apple is looking to buy a startup in the UK for $1 billion."

# Process the text
doc = nlp(text)

# Extract named entities
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(f"{ent.text} ({ent.label_})")
```

**Output:**
```
Apple (ORG)
UK (GPE)
$1 billion (MONEY)
```

---

### **4. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging (NLP)**

**Explanation:**
POS tagging involves identifying the grammatical parts of speech (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives) for each word in a sentence.

**Example (Python - NLTK):**
We will use the **NLTK** library to tag the parts of speech in a sentence.

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')

# Sample text
text = "Python is a powerful programming language."

# Tokenize the text and tag parts of speech
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
tags = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)

# Print the POS tags
print(tags)
```

**Output:**
```
[('Python', 'NNP'), ('is', 'VBZ'), ('a', 'DT'), ('powerful', 'JJ'), ('programming', 'NN'), ('language', 'NN'), ('.', '.')]
```
Explanation of POS tags:
- **NNP** = Proper noun (e.g., "Python")
- **VBZ** = Verb, 3rd person singular (e.g., "is")
- **DT** = Determiner (e.g., "a")
- **JJ** = Adjective (e.g., "powerful")
- **NN** = Noun, singular (e.g., "programming")

---

### **5. Language Translation (NLP)**

**Explanation:**
Language translation uses NLP techniques to translate text from one language to another. We can use libraries like `googletrans` for automatic translation.

**Example (Python - googletrans):**
We'll use the **googletrans** library to translate text from English to French.

```python
from googletrans import Translator

# Create a Translator object
translator = Translator()

# Translate text
text = "Hello, how are you?"
translated = translator.translate(text, src='en', dest='fr')

# Print the translation
print(f"Original: {text}")
print(f"Translated: {translated.text}")
```

**Output:**
```
Original: Hello, how are you?
Translated: Bonjour comment Ã§a va?
```

(Note: `googletrans` is an unofficial library that interacts with Google's translation API. You might need an internet connection to use it.)

---

### **Conclusion:**

I provided small programs for the following NLP tasks:

1. **Text Classification** (using Scikit-learn)
2. **Sentiment Analysis** (using TextBlob)
3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** (using SpaCy)
4. **Part-of-Speech Tagging** (using NLTK)
5. **Language Translation** (using googletrans)

Each example includes the code and the expected output. These are just simple applications of NLP, but they form the basis for more complex tasks in real-world scenarios.

Let me know if you need any more details or have specific questions!

Sure! Let's dive into **Computer Vision** techniques. I'll explain a few common techniques and provide small examples with code and output.

---

### **1. Image Classification**

**Explanation:**
Image classification is the task of assigning a label (or class) to an image based on its content. For example, determining whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

**Example (Python - Keras with TensorFlow backend):**
We'll use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the **CIFAR-10** dataset, which contains 10 classes of images (e.g., airplane, dog, car, etc.).

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import cifar10

# Load CIFAR-10 dataset
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()

# Normalize the data
X_train, X_test = X_train / 255.0, X_test / 255.0

# Build the CNN model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5)

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc}")
```

**Output:**
```
Test accuracy: 0.7318
```

---

### **2. Object Detection**

**Explanation:**
Object detection involves not only identifying objects in an image but also determining their locations (bounding boxes). Common models for object detection include YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN.

**Example (Python - OpenCV with pre-trained Haar Cascade for Face Detection):**
In this example, we use OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in an image.

```python
import cv2

# Load the pre-trained Haar Cascade face detection model
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

# Load an image
image = cv2.imread('image.jpg')  # Replace 'image.jpg' with the path to your image
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Detect faces
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))

# Draw rectangles around detected faces
for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
    cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (255, 0, 0), 2)

# Display the result
cv2.imshow('Detected Faces', image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

**Output:**
The program will display the image with rectangles drawn around detected faces. You will need an image that contains faces for this to work properly.

---

### **3. Image Segmentation**

**Explanation:**
Image segmentation is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments to simplify or change the representation of an image. This can be useful for identifying objects or boundaries within an image.

**Example (Python - OpenCV for simple threshold-based segmentation):**
This example segments an image into foreground and background based on pixel intensity.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load an image
image = cv2.imread('image.jpg')  # Replace 'image.jpg' with the path to your image
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply a simple threshold to segment the image
_, thresholded_image = cv2.threshold(gray, 120, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

# Display the original and segmented images
cv2.imshow('Original Image', image)
cv2.imshow('Segmented Image', thresholded_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

**Output:**
The program will display the original image and the segmented (thresholded) image. The background will be black, and the foreground will be white.

---

### **4. Face Recognition**

**Explanation:**
Face recognition involves identifying or verifying a person from an image or video based on facial features. It can be done by training on datasets of faces and using algorithms to identify individuals.

**Example (Python - Face Recognition library):**
We'll use the **face_recognition** library, which simplifies face recognition tasks.

```python
import face_recognition
import cv2

# Load an image with faces
image = cv2.imread('image.jpg')  # Replace 'image.jpg' with the path to your image
rgb_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# Find all face locations in the image
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(rgb_image)

# Draw rectangles around the faces
for top, right, bottom, left in face_locations:
    cv2.rectangle(image, (left, top), (right, bottom), (0, 255, 0), 2)

# Display the result
cv2.imshow('Face Recognition', image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

**Output:**
The program will display the image with rectangles drawn around recognized faces. Ensure the `face_recognition` library is installed (you can install it via `pip install face_recognition`).

---

### **5. Image Generation (Deep Learning)**

**Explanation:**
Image generation is a task where a model generates new images, often from a random noise vector or from some other input. One popular technique is using **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**.

**Example (Python - Simple GAN with Keras for generating MNIST digits):**
This example will generate handwritten digits using a simple GAN.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Build the generator model
generator = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    layers.Dense(784, activation='sigmoid'),
    layers.Reshape((28, 28, 1))
])

# Build the discriminator model
discriminator = models.Sequential([
    layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the discriminator
discriminator.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Create the GAN model
discriminator.trainable = False
gan_input = layers.Input(shape=(100,))
x = generator(gan_input)
gan_output = discriminator(x)
gan = models.Model(gan_input, gan_output)
gan.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Train the GAN (simplified example, not a full training loop)
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist

# Load MNIST dataset
(X_train, _), (_, _) = mnist.load_data()
X_train = X_train / 255.0
X_train = X_train.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1)

# Train for a few epochs (not a complete training loop here)
for epoch in range(5):
    noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, (32, 100))
    generated_images = generator.predict(noise)
    real_images = X_train[np.random.randint(0, X_train.shape[0], 32)]

    # Train the discriminator
    discriminator.trainable = True
    discriminator.train_on_batch(real_images, np.ones((32, 1)))
    discriminator.train_on_batch(generated_images, np.zeros((32, 1)))

    # Train the generator via the GAN model
    discriminator.trainable = False
    gan.train_on_batch(noise, np.ones((32, 1)))

# Generate an image
noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, (1, 100))
generated_image = generator.predict(noise)

# Display the generated image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.imshow(generated_image[0, :, :, 0], cmap='gray')
plt.show()
```

**Output:**
This code generates and displays a random image of a handwritten digit after training. The generated image will be a synthetic number similar to those in the MNIST dataset.

---

### **Conclusion:**

Hereâ€™s a summary of the **Computer Vision** techniques covered:

1. **Image Classification** (using CNNs with Keras)
2. **Object Detection** (using OpenCV and Haar Cascade)
3. **Image Segmentation** (using OpenCV for thresholding)
4. **Face Recognition** (using the `face_recognition` library)
5. **Image Generation** (using GANs in Keras)

These are basic examples, and many can be expanded into more complex models for real-world tasks. Let me know if you need further details or other examples!

Certainly! Let's dive into **Robotics Techniques** and explore common techniques used in the field of robotics. I'll provide an explanation, a small program example, and expected output for each technique.

---

### **1. Control Systems**

**Explanation:**
Control systems in robotics are used to manage the motion of robots. These systems take in sensor inputs (like position or velocity) and provide control signals to actuators (such as motors) to achieve desired behavior.

A simple example is a **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controller**, which adjusts the control signal based on the error between the current state and desired state.

**Example (Python - Simple Proportional Controller for a Robot):**

This example simulates a basic proportional controller for a robot trying to reach a target position.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Target position
target_position = 10

# Initial position of the robot
position = 0

# Proportional gain (Kp)
Kp = 0.1

# Simulation of movement over time
positions = []
for step in range(100):
    error = target_position - position  # Calculate the error
    position += Kp * error  # Update the position (control law)
    positions.append(position)

# Plot the results
plt.plot(positions)
plt.axhline(y=target_position, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Target')
plt.xlabel('Time step')
plt.ylabel('Position')
plt.title('Robot Position Control (Proportional Control)')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

**Output:**
The plot shows the robot's position converging towards the target over time, as the proportional controller adjusts its movements based on the error.

---

### **2. Navigation**

**Explanation:**
In robotics, navigation is the process by which a robot determines its position and plans a path to reach a destination. Common techniques include **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)** and **path planning algorithms**.

A simple example is **A* Algorithm**, which is widely used for pathfinding and navigation.

**Example (Python - A* Pathfinding Algorithm):**

```python
import heapq

# Define the grid (0 = free space, 1 = obstacle)
grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

# A* Pathfinding algorithm
def a_star(grid, start, end):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    open_list = []
    closed_list = set()
    heapq.heappush(open_list, (0 + abs(start[0] - end[0]) + abs(start[1] - end[1]), 0, start))
    
    came_from = {}

    while open_list:
        _, g, current = heapq.heappop(open_list)
        if current == end:
            path = []
            while current in came_from:
                path.append(current)
                current = came_from[current]
            path.append(start)
            return path[::-1]

        closed_list.add(current)

        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            neighbor = (current[0] + dx, current[1] + dy)
            if 0 <= neighbor[0] < rows and 0 <= neighbor[1] < cols and grid[neighbor[0]][neighbor[1]] == 0 and neighbor not in closed_list:
                heapq.heappush(open_list, (g + 1 + abs(neighbor[0] - end[0]) + abs(neighbor[1] - end[1]), g + 1, neighbor))
                came_from[neighbor] = current
    
    return None

# Start and end points
start = (0, 0)
end = (4, 4)

# Find the path using A*
path = a_star(grid, start, end)
print("Path found:", path)
```

**Output:**
```
Path found: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)]
```

This shows the optimal path for the robot to navigate from the start `(0, 0)` to the destination `(4, 4)` while avoiding obstacles (`1`s in the grid).

---

### **3. Mapping (SLAM)**

**Explanation:**
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) allows a robot to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of its own location within that environment.

SLAM typically involves sensors like LIDAR or cameras. A simplified example of SLAM is **EKF-SLAM (Extended Kalman Filter SLAM)**, where the robotâ€™s position and map are updated as it moves.

For simplicity, here is a basic **Particle Filter-based SLAM** approach.

**Example (Python - Simplified Particle Filter for SLAM):**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Initialize particles (position guesses)
particles = np.random.rand(100, 2) * 10  # 100 particles in a 10x10 grid
weights = np.ones(100) / 100  # Equal weights for each particle

# True position of the robot (unknown to the filter)
true_position = np.array([5, 5])

# Movement model (move by (1, 0) in each step)
movement = np.array([1, 0])

# Update particles with the movement model
particles += movement + np.random.randn(100, 2) * 0.1  # Adding noise to simulate uncertainty

# Plot particles before and after movement
plt.scatter(particles[:, 0], particles[:, 1], color='blue', label='Particles')
plt.scatter(true_position[0], true_position[1], color='red', label='True Position')
plt.title("Particle Filter SLAM Example")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

**Output:**
The program will display a scatter plot showing particles before and after the movement. The true position is marked in red, while the particles' positions are shown in blue.

---

### **4. Localization**

**Explanation:**
Localization is the process of determining the robotâ€™s position within a known environment. In a typical indoor environment, a robot might use **odometry** (distance traveled) combined with **sensor data** (like LIDAR) to estimate its position.

**Example (Python - Simple Odometry Estimation):**

```python
import math

# Robot's initial position (x, y, orientation)
position = [0, 0, 0]  # x, y, theta

# Function to update the position
def update_position(position, left_wheel_distance, right_wheel_distance, wheel_base):
    # Compute the robot's displacement (distance moved)
    delta_distance = (left_wheel_distance + right_wheel_distance) / 2
    delta_theta = (right_wheel_distance - left_wheel_distance) / wheel_base

    # Update position (simple odometry)
    position[2] += delta_theta  # Update orientation (theta)
    position[0] += delta_distance * math.cos(position[2])  # Update x
    position[1] += delta_distance * math.sin(position[2])  # Update y

    return position

# Move the robot (left and right wheel distances, wheelbase of the robot)
new_position = update_position(position, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5)
print("Updated Position:", new_position)
```

**Output:**
```
Updated Position: [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
```

This simple example uses the robot's wheel distances and wheelbase to estimate its new position using basic odometry.

### **5. Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**

**Explanation:**
Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is the field of study that focuses on the interactions between humans and robots. Robots can be designed to understand and respond to human gestures, voice commands, and other inputs.

**Example (Python - Simple Voice Command Processing):**

We will use the `speech_recognition` library to capture voice input from the user.

```python
import speech_recognition as sr

# Initialize recognizer
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

# Capture voice input from the microphone
with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("Say something:")
    audio = recognizer.listen(source)

# Recognize speech
try:
    command = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
    print("You said:", command)
except sr.UnknownValueError:
    print("Sorry, I could not understand the audio.")
except sr.RequestError:
    print("Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service.")
```

**Output:**
```
Say something:
You said: Turn on the light
```

The robot recognizes the command "Turn on the light" through voice recognition and can act accordingly (e.g., turning on a light if connected to IoT).
